    """
    Decorator to measure and print CPU usage, memory consumption, and execution time
    of a function.
¬°
    The following metrics are reported:
    - Execution time (in seconds)
    - Peak memory usage (in megabytes)
    - CPU usage percentage (sampled after execution)

    Output is printed to the console and flushed immediately, making it suitable for
    use in Jupyter Notebooks and scripts.

    Parameters:
    func (callable): The function whose performance is to be measured.

    Returns:
    callable: A wrapped version of the original function that includes resource tracking
